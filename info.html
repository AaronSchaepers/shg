      <h2>The discovery</h2>
      <p>
        The story of Stonehenge Garching begins with the construction of a new physics laboratory on a research
        campus close to the pulsating town of Garching, near Munich.
      </p>
      <p>
        The new laboratory was to be located at the
        north-eastern outskirts of the research campus, where modern urbanity gives way to uncharted wilderness. The
        frontier of civilization had to be pushed further into the Bavarian badlands to clear the ground of the construction site,
        claiming the lives of five workers that fell victim to tropical diseases and the uncontrollable fauna of that area.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was in
        the course of this dangerous pioneering effort that workers stumbled across Stonehenge Garching, waking it from
        age-long hibernation hidden in impenetrable woods. Recognizing it at once as a historical site of incredible
        importance, the authorities revised the original building plans to ensure the preservation of this new discovery.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-block">
      <h2>The origins</h2>
      <p>
        The origins of this prehistoric site are shrouded in the mist of time. A radiocarbon analysis tentatively dates
        the time of creation back to the 1830s, however scientists are at a loss to explain the details of
        its construction.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Garching region is known to have been inhabited by a scattered and primitive people at
        that time, while the creation of Stonehenge Garching would have required manpower and craftsmanship comparable
        to that of an ancient civilization, well beyond the scope of the worthy local population.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scientific
        community must therefore turn to other theories to explain the origins of Stonehenge Garching, many of which
        have emerged since the discovery. They attribute the construction to a variety of external powers, including
        aliens, an obscure phallic cult, frustrated astrophysicists, and most controversial of all, an artist.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-block">
      <h2>The purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The theories regarding the purpose of Stonehenge Garching differ according to the supposed creator.
      </p>
      <p>
        The alien theory claims that Stonehenge Garching is the burial site of several extraterrestrial individuals who
        perished during a botched research exchange with a young Dr. Theodor Hänsch. Brutal experiments on early
        frequency combs (lasers) may have ended in tragedy, while also giving rise to the quote that „anything will lase
        if you hit it hard enough amk“. Presumably, the aliens’ metabolism did not respond well to atomic population
        inversion. Critics of this theory point out that Dr. Theodor Hänsch was in fact born two decades after the
        alleged time of construction and that it is very questionable that space-traveling aliens, with the whole planet
        open to them, would visit Garching.
      </p>
      <p>
        The theory of a phallic cult being at the bottom of Stonehenge Garching explains it as a place of worship. In
        its favor it can be said that most research institutions in close proximity to Stonehenge Garching have a long
        history of very hierarchical and overwhelmingly male-dominated structures. Such environments have repeatedly
        been proven to promote the formation of said cults, the most prominent historical examples being the military,
        the church and conservative governments. A weak point to this hypothesis is that it puts a doubtfully low bound
        on the artistic skill of the cult members, or instead postulates a dramatic change in human anatomy since the
        erection of the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those supporting the theory of frustrated astrophysicists state that the sometime in the late 18th century, the
        prolonged failure to detect the faintest trace of dark matter or energy may have caused parts of the community
        simply to crack. According to this theory, Stonehenge Garching was then build out of the need to give physical
        form to the state of complete inner upheaval into which the desperate scientists were plunged by the continued
        absence of significant data. It is speculated that they chanted in plain LaTeX to appease whatever gods they
        believed responsible for their scientific dead end. When asked to comment, members of the TUM chair of
        Theoretical Elementary Particle Physics refused to interrupt their attempts to frantically renormalize the
        departmental coffee budget, which had blown up in their faces after they assumed it to be a small perturbation
        (story of their lives).
      </p>
      <p>
        The artist theory proposes that Stonehenge Garching is not a scientific or religious relic at all, but a
        conceptual art installation. According to this view, the stones were arranged by an anonymous artist aiming to
        explore themes like critical space abundance, the color grey, and the inspiring solidity of rocks. Critics point
        out that this is completely ridiculous, while supporters counter that that is precisely the point, that the
        critics clearly didn’t understand the deconstruction of objecthood in a post-anthropocentric epistemological
        framework, and that they should read Karl Popper and Adorno before talking to them again. Concluding, it can be
        said that in the context of contemporary art this theory, while unlikely, cannot be fully ruled out.
